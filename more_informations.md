## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to enhance the capabilities of an autonomous robot through vocal interaction. The starting point involves basic behaviors controlled by voice commands. The goal is to take these initial behaviors and use Behavior Trees in C++ to make them more complex, increasing the level of dynamism and adaptability of the robot's behaviors.

## Key Achievements

- **Developed new features for an autonomous robot using the ROS operating system**
- **Designed and implemented new complex skills using Behavior Trees in C++**
- **Structured and implemented vocal interaction using Python and YAML, leveraging the RASA framework for vocal interaction with the robot**
- **Resolved a bug in the RASA Action Server to extend the duration of custom actions from 10 seconds to hours**
